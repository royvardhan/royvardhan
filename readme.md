## Work

##### [VAPORDEX: $3M+ Quarterly Volume](https://app.vapordex.io/swap)
 - Worked on adding new features/pages to the NEXT.JS frontend. 
 - Integrated GraphQL APIs to fetch server-side props and show them on the frontend.
 - Worked with Vercel edge configs to limit features to users before the release date.
 - Integrated smart contracts with pages.

##### [VAPORDEX: Aggregator Smart Contract](https://app.vapordex.io/swap)
 - An Aggregator Contract that routes calls to other dexes with best quotes.
 - Adapters of other dexes for compatibility and access to liquidity of other dexes. 
 - Integrated it with Diamond Pattern, to allow for multiple logic.
 - CREATE3 deployment scripts, custom ABI generation scripts.

##### [Liquid Mining: $1.7M TVL All Seasons Combined](https://github.com/VaporFi/liquid-mining)
* I contributed to this ERC-2535 implementation that has multiple facets such as Deposit, Withdraw, Claim, Boost and Unlock. Each facet has a dedicated smart contract, connected with the diamond. I authored the Claim, and Withdraw contracts(facets).
* I also set up extensive tests in Foundry, created the diamonds, connected facets to it and made the test coverage to 90%+.

##### [Liquid Mining Subgraph](https://github.com/VaporFi/liquid-mining](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/royvardhan/genesisv4)
* I designed it to provide comprehensive data on the activities within the Liquid Mining smart contract ecosystem. It facilitates queries to retrieve detailed information about user interactions, seasonal data, fee collections, and mining pass purchases.

##### [Genesis Staking: $312,744 TVL](https://snowtrace.io/address/0xd21fe537c97054f40890f012955a536d80d1bf00)
- I contributed to this smart contract and it has handled $312,744 in total value so far and was built for a special event where it accepted a live token (with deep liquidity pools) and emitted a new token based on TVL at the end of the staking event.
- A total of 2729 unique wallets participated in this event.

##### [Genesis Staking Subgraph](https://github.com/royvardhan/genesis-staking-subgraph)
- A subgraph that tracks all the deposits and claims in the vault.
- The subgraph also queries the liquidity pools of the deposit token and calculates the real-time USD price of the deposit token to determine the real-time price of the claim token.

##### [Emissions Manager: Auto Emits VAPE Token to Liquid Mining SC](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x9f0EDB45c2DC0f56bA7C48368c26426f366Bb788)
- A smart contract that works with other contracts to mint new tokens automatically based
on a certain set of rules.
- An admin smart contract for managing mining rewards inside Liquid Mining.


##### [Quadratic Voting ERC721](https://github.com/royvardhan/quadraticVotingERC721/blob/main/contracts/QuadraticVotingERC721.sol)
 - A voting Dapp that accepts proposals for NFTs and allows NFT holders to vote.
 - A vote's weight depends upon the number of NFTs the voter holds.
