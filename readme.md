## Work

##### [Liquid Mining: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy Smart Contracts](https://github.com/VaporFi/liquid-mining)
* I contributed to this ERC-2535 implementation that has multiple facets such as Deposit, Withdraw, Claim, Re-stake, Boost, and Unlock. Each facet has a dedicated smart contract, connected with the diamond. 
* I authored the Claim, Restake, and Withdraw contracts (facets). I also set up extensive tests in Foundry, created the diamonds, connected facets to it, and made the test coverage to 90%+.


##### [Genesis Staking: An Event Based Smart Contract](https://snowtrace.io/address/0xd21fe537c97054f40890f012955a536d80d1bf00)
- I contributed to this smart contract and it has handled $312,744 in total value so far and was built for a special event where it accepted a live token (with deep liquidity pools) and emitted a new token based on TVL at the end of the staking event.
- A total of 2729 unique wallets participated in this event.

##### [Genesis Staking Subgraph](https://github.com/royvardhan/genesis-staking-subgraph)
- A subgraph that tracks all the deposits and claims in the vault.
- The subgraph also queries the liquidity pools of the deposit token and calculates the real-time USD price of the deposit token to determine the real-time price of the claim token.

##### [VAPORDEX](https://app.vapordex.io/swap)
 - Worked on adding new features/pages to the NEXT.JS frontend. 
 - Integrated GraphQL APIs to fetch server-side props and show them on the frontend.
 - Worked with Vercel edge configs to limit features to users before the release date.
 - Integrated smart contracts with pages.

##### [Quadratic Voting ERC721](https://github.com/royvardhan/quadraticVotingERC721/blob/main/contracts/QuadraticVotingERC721.sol)
 - A voting Dapp that accepts proposals for NFTs and allows NFT holders to vote.
 - A vote's weight depends upon the number of NFTs the voter holds.
